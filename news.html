The 1987 Philippine Constitution adopts as a matter of principle under Section 17 thereof, that the State shall give priority to education and various other allied fields as potent means to foster patriotism and nationalism, accelerate social progress, and promote total human liberation and development. Republic Act No. 7722 or the Higher Education Act of 1994 provides for a broad agenda for reforms in the country’s education system. The law established the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) both public and private, which have demonstrated the highest degree or level of standards along with the areas of instruction, research, and extension of their particular fields or courses, CSPC included. In reciprocation to the policies of the Local Government Unit of Buhi and the CSPC, both have come to terms as regards to the opening of CSPC Buhi Campus facilities to cater to the growing population of tertiary level students especially from the marginalized sector. The present site of CSPC campus at San Buenaventura has ostensibly become inadequate in terms of space to accommodate the enrollees.
	The Local Government Unit of Buhi through Expropriation Ordinance No. 13-130, Series of 2013 and Resolution No. 13-016 dated February 4, 2013, has initiated expropriation proceedings to cultivate a parcel of the lot located at Lourdes, Buhi, Camarines Sur for public use under an Order from the Honorable Court, the subject property has already been delivered to the possession of the LGU and therefore has already the rightful claim or prerogative over the same.

The lot area to be occupied and ownership has a total of 10,000 square meters will be allowed for the use of the Usufructuary as the locale of the CSPC Buhi Campus.

		 								<h2>COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A Changed World</h2>
		 								<h5>JOBERT CANON, JALLEN DACUBA AND PEARL ANN ALAPAD</h5>
		 							</div><hr/>
		 							<div class="text-justify">	
		 								<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the defining global health crisis of the time and the greatest challenge the world is facing nowadays. This pandemic is much more than health crisis as it is also an unprecedented socio-economic crisis. Stressing all of the countries, it touches and has the potential to create devastating health, social, economic and political effects that may leave a longstanding scars.
	COVID-19 is rapidly spreading around the world. In order to slowdown the transmission of the disease in the community, many of the affected countries have decided to undergo total lockdown. Due to lockdown, major international flights and all types of business transports have been deferred amid different countries. Furthermore, people belonging to the tourism and transportation industry are highly affected and facing utmost difficulties. Also, the economy of the countries are facing the threat of high inflation and increasing of unemployment.
	Every day, people are losing jobs and income with no way of knowing when normality will return, which could mean thousands or millions of people will not be able to meet their basic needs. Aside from that, the educational sector is also been affected, where some countries have to declared a suspension, while some are making ways to move forward such as online classes. The pandemic also brought changed to the way how the people live, in where, physical distancing is needed, wearing face mask and regularly washing of hands. In additon, this Covid 19 has affected the sources of supply and effects the global economy. There are restrictions of travelling from one country to another country. During travelling numbers of cases are identified positive when tested, especially when they are taking international visits. All governments, health organizations and other authorities are continuously cynosuring on identifying the cases affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Health care professional face a lot of difficulties in maintaining the quality of healthcare in these days. One of the key challenges in managing this public health crisis has been the production and distribution of medical devices, surgical supplies and pharmaceuticals to those on the clinical frontline.
	COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly put forth remarkably bad effects on the day to day life of the entire human society and on the world economy.

		 							<h2>IMPACT  OF COVID-19 PANDEDMIC TO HUMAN RIGHTS</h2>
		 							<h5>MA. SOLEDAD C. NAÑEZ</h5>
		 						</div>
		 						<div class="text-justify">
		 							<p>“How does Covid-19 affect human rights?” 
Human rights are basically the rights of an individual such as freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution regarded as belonging fundamentally to all persons. No one has the right to execute an individual. We must not put the law on our hands. All of us have the privilege to live, to love, and to enjoy the independence of being bestowed on us. Each of us has the appanage to live the life we wanted. Nevertheless, we are obligated to strictly abide the constitution or an ordinance being implemented by the state. Human rights are being challenged by this newly found virus, the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 or widely known as the COVID-19. It is being entitled as pandemic because it spread out all over the world. This virus originated form Wuhan, China and is now over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population. COVID-19 have been killing millions of people all over the world and still continuing the count of affected individuals. 
The entire world is affected. As a response to this threat,  the government proposed a law that includes safety measures and prevention of COVID-19. The law itself is not against human rights who are under range but it depends on the law enforcers on how they initiate the law, and to the individuals who must follow the law. There are some enforcers who are using their power to violate the rights of individuals for their own interest and on the other hand, there are individuals who are using the law under human rights to make excuses from their mistakes.  The protocols, laws and rules about COVID-19 are indeed important. It depends on the law enforcers and affected individuals, both ways, in creating  impacts on rights as humans.
Technically, before COVID outbreak, it is just okay to sneeze, cough and talk in public, post on social medias that they are sick or has a fever. But, can you identify the difference of way of life of the people before the COVID-19 pandemic on to present time? Simple, these days, whether you sneeze or cough, people would say it is COVID. A simple fever is COVID. A simple body pain is COVID. Out of these, people of today’s being so irrational on criticizing other people  yet, they’re not bothered if they are acting rude and inconsiderate of what the subjected  individual might feel.
Nowadays, people instantly became chemists, pretending to know everything. No one wanted this thing to happen, nobody wished for virus to go on its way ruining lives of many. People are being hypocrite that some became analysts, economists, a doctor and the president in just a snap. Some became jerry-rigged, not caring about what might  happen if the precautionary health protocols be violated. Some chose to stay far from the others. Some intend to traduce the identity of a patient infected with the virus. Some became privacy invaders and some even condemned the patients. 
Instead of putting blame on the people who got ill because of the virus, why not help and pray for them. Let us not denounce them. They did not want to risk their lives and be infected by COVID-19, so does their family who cannot afford to lose a member. Each of us must be vigilant and mindful to be safe. 
Living in the new normal, wearing facemask and face shield and physical distancing is a MUST to be followed and observe. Doing and conforming the health standards will save us from the risk of coronavirus. We heal as one!

		 							</div>
		 							<div class="text-justify">
		 								<p>	A strong partnership built by trust and hard work led us to accessible and competitive State University College in Buhi which was established in the year 2008 and where the partnership of CSPC and LGU Buhi begin.
	It’s been 12 years since the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges Buhi Extension Campus commenced. Reminiscing how great and fortunate the Municipality of Buhi for having the CSPC Buhi Extension Campus in town. Indeed, it was an answer to the conceit of humanity, which bestowed hope upon dreamers.
	After a lot of brainstorming, feasibility was conducted to determine the viability of opening such extension campus where after yielded a positive result through the effort and help of the Sangguniang Bayan ng Buhi of Camarines Sur. The memorandum agreement was then duly finalized last February 28, 2008, where the Board of Trustees approved the resolution No. 08-439 for the operation of CSPC Buhi Extension Campus.
	The first site of CSPC Buhi Extension Campus was located at Butil Building of the Buhi Central School, offering; Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED), BS Electronic & Communication Engineering (BSECE), and BS Information Technology (BSIT) with the first Campus Coordinator,Mrs. Eden I. Fabellare. In 2011 CSPC Buhi Extension Campus was transferred to Cresino Building, San Buenaventura Buhi Camarines Sur, in the same year, with Dr. Concepcion I. De la Rama, who was designated as Campus Coordinator until October 2011; was then duly taken over to Mrs. Lourdes L. Bisenio in October 2011 to October 2012, where after to Mrs. Helen V. Zaballa on November 2012 to December 2019.
	In present, the firm partnership of CSPC and the LGU Buhi continues. The LGU Buhi headed by Municipal Mayor Margie M. Aguinillo and CSPC headed by Dr. Charlito P. Cadag, together with new Campus Director Prof. Hejie Andalis Dimabogte are still hand in hand in improving the quality of tertiary education in town. 
	The LGU Buhi never suppresses in helping, supporting, and being part of the institution’s journey for about years. Massive contributions were catered by the LGU Buhi to CSPC. To name a few; LGU Buhi imparted their kindness and support to CSPC through helping our school to partly pay in percentage manner the employee’s salary until 2015; pays the rent for the building along with electric and water bills to attain the accessibility in school; allow students to use the Millennium Center, Social Covered Court, and Magindara Resort for school activities; lend their support, especially during intramurals by allowing the school to be accommodated by the municipal vehicles, and provides the manpower for the after-care technology of the activity. 
	Furthermore, the LGU BUHI grants scholarships to the students through financial support to deserving selected students.
This kind of established relationship between LGU and CSPC inspires more students to achieve their goals in life.

On 12th day of March, 2020, CSPC College Nurse visited Buhi Campus. Resident Nurse Jerome Francia demonstrated and discussed the causes and effects of the virus, so as to maintain a healthy immune system.  Nurse Francia discussed that some of its mild symptoms includes fever, cough and colds, and difficulty of breathing. In severe cases, it may cause to Pneumonia, Acute Respiratory Syndrome, kidney disease and even death.
 In order to prevent these factors, Nurse Francia taught the students to do social distancing (at least 1 meter away), a regular washing of hands (for at least 20 seconds) and to wear face mask.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) named the controversial virus as COVID-19, NCOV before, is from a family of viruses that cause many illnesses, from a simple cough and cold up to severe infection. It can be foist through inhalation of droplets of saliva from an infected person, and this is called droplet transmission.
With its rampancy all around the country, CSPC College Nurse raised awareness and prevention tips aversely on COVID-19 so as to minimize and help the government stop the proliferation of the virus. 
It is a tough battle that the world is facing at present.  But as one world, interdependently and mutually uniting to fight against COVID-19, we will heal as one.
