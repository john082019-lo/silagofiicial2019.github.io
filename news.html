The 1987 Philippine Constitution adopts as a matter of principle under Section 17 thereof, that the State shall give priority to education and various other allied fields as potent means to foster patriotism and nationalism, accelerate social progress, and promote total human liberation and development. Republic Act No. 7722 or the Higher Education Act of 1994 provides for a broad agenda for reforms in the country’s education system. The law established the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) both public and private, which have demonstrated the highest degree or level of standards along with the areas of instruction, research, and extension of their particular fields or courses, CSPC included. In reciprocation to the policies of the Local Government Unit of Buhi and the CSPC, both have come to terms as regards to the opening of CSPC Buhi Campus facilities to cater to the growing population of tertiary level students especially from the marginalized sector. The present site of CSPC campus at San Buenaventura has ostensibly become inadequate in terms of space to accommodate the enrollees.

The lot area to be occupied and ownership has a total of 10,000 square meters will be allowed for the use of the Usufructuary as the locale of the CSPC Buhi Campus.
